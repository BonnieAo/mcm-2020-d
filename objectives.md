- Create a network for the ball passing between players, where each player is a node and each pass constitutes a link between players.

    Use your passing network to identify network patterns, such as **dyadic** and **triadic** configurations and team formations. Also consider other structural indicators and network properties across the games. You should explore multiple scales such as, but not limited to, micro (pairwise) to macro (all players) when looking at interactions, and time such as short (minute-to-minute) to long (entire game or entire season).


- Identify performance indicators that reflect successful teamwork (in addition to points or wins) such as diversity in the types of plays, coordination among players or distribution of contributions.

    You also may consider other team level processes, such as adaptability, flexibility, tempo,or flow. It may be important to clarify whether strategies are universally effective or dependent on opponentsâ€™ counter-strategies. Use the performance indicators and team level processes that you have identified to create a model that captures structural, configurational, and dynamical aspects of teamwork.


- Use the insights gained from your teamwork model to inform the coach about what kinds of structural strategies have been effective for the Huskies.

    Advise the coach on what changes the network analysis indicates that they should make next season to improve team success.


- Your analysis of the Huskies has allowed you to consider group dynamics in a controlled setting of a team sport. Understanding the complex set of factors that make some groups perform better than others is critical for how societies develop and innovate. As our societies increasingly solve problems involving teams, can you generalize your findings to say something about how to design more effective teams? What other aspects of teamwork would need to be captured to develop generalized models of team performance?
