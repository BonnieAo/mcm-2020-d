- Number of `Duel`s
- Number of `Free Kick`s and `Shot`s
- Number of `Save attempt`s
- Number of `Clearance`s (解围)
- Number of `One Touch`s

> A one touch in soccer is a specific style of play where the players move the ball around quickly with a simple tap or hit of the ball. Once the ball comes in their direction, the player receives and passes the ball to the next player with the same touch. Needing a quick hit, the player does not trap or dribble the ball first before moving it along. Although it is common with passing, a one touch hit is also used for shooting the ball on goal.
> This skill is good for teams needing to move the ball around quickly or to get a shot off quickly. For example, a player may send the ball over to their teammate who is breaking towards the goal and the receiving player may hit the ball with a split-second one touch to beat the keeper.
